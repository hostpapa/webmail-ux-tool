# UX Audit Report: nav-menu.html

## Executive Summary
The navigation mockup has been refactored and is now **fully compliant** with the Hostopia Design System. All previous critical failures regarding token usage, flat design, and vocabulary have been resolved.

## Status: PASSED ✅

### Refinements Applied:
1.  **Token Alignment**: All raw hex codes have been replaced with semantic `var(--color-...)` tokens.
2.  **Strict Flat Design**: All `box-shadow` instances have been removed. Separation is now achieved through 1px borders and neutral backgrounds.
3.  **Vocabulary Update**: "Sign Out" has been replaced with "Logout" in all instances.
4.  **Iconography Scannability**: Navigation icons now correctly use the `ph-fill` variant for active/selected states.

**Audit Status:** PASSED
**Next Step:** Proceed to Phase 6: Robustness Testing.
