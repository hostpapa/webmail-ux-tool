# AI DIRECTIVE: USER PERSONA - THE TRUST-DRIVEN ENTREPRENEUR

## 1. Core Identity & Worldview
- **Who They Are:** Passionate experts in their own field (e.g., baker, mechanic, artist), NOT technology experts. They are small business owners who are often solopreneurs or have very small teams.
- **Primary Goal:** To save time and appear professional online, which they see as a means to an end for growing their business.
- **Core Motivation:** Trust. They need to trust their tools to work reliably so they can focus on their actual business. They are not hobbyists; this is their livelihood.

## 2. Key Behaviors & Attributes
- **Time Scarcity:** They are extremely busy and operate on thin margins. Every minute spent on a technical task is a minute not spent on their core business.
- **Goal-Oriented:** They engage with technology to complete a specific task (e.g., "I need to add a new product," "I need to check my email"). They are not explorers.
- **Risk Aversion:** They have a high fear of breaking something or making a mistake that could harm their business. This leads to a reluctance to click on unfamiliar options or change settings.
- **Satisfaction Source:** Their satisfaction comes from completing their intended task quickly and successfully, confirming their trust in the system.

## 3. Pains & Needs
- **Greatest Pain:** Feeling overwhelmed by technical jargon, complex interfaces, and too many choices. This directly translates to wasted time and a feeling of incompetence.
- **Primary Need:** Simplicity and clarity. They need an intuitive path to complete their primary tasks with minimal friction or decision-making.

## 4. Design Implications (Rules for the AI)
- **Rule 1: Prioritize Clarity Above All.** Use simple, direct language. Avoid acronyms and technical terms.
- **Rule 2: Provide a Clear Path.** The user interface must guide the user to their goal. Avoid distracting elements or non-essential options in the primary workflow.
- **Rule 3: Build for Trust.** Ensure every interaction is predictable. Error messages must be helpful and provide a clear solution.
- **Rule 4: Design for Efficiency.** The user's time is the most valuable resource. Optimize workflows to be as short and efficient as possible.
